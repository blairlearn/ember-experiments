If you are starting to read the book, this version of the code is suggested.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my version of the Ember.js official starter kit.

Inside the css folder is the styles that will be used by the application.

Inside the js folder is the Ember.js code seperated into the models, views, and controllers folders.
The /js/libs folder includes the libraries needed for the sample application.

The img folder contains a glyphicons.png file that is used for displaying icons in the application.

All you have to do to view the code all together is copy the following file into a browse:

	index.html

There are code snippets from the book inside snippets/executableCodeSnippets that you can copy and paste into the console of a web browser.
